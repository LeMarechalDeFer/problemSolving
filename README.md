# ðŸš€ Problem Solving & Algorithms  

Welcome to my learning repository for **algorithms and data structures**. This project is designed to structure my understanding following a progressive methodology.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective  

This repository contains my algorithm implementations, accompanied by detailed explanations, unit tests, and benchmarks.  
The objective is to:  
- âœ… Understand data structures and algorithms in depth.  
- âœ… Promote memorization by avoiding mechanical repetition
- âœ… Document each algorithm for better understanding.  
- âœ… Automate tests with GitHub Actions.

## Problem Solving Methodology

1. Understand the problem
2. Plan the solution
3. Implement the solution
4. Test the solution
5. Refactor the solution


---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure  

Each algorithm is organized in a folder containing:

- âœ… Implementation (C/C++, Python, Java, TypeScript)
- âœ… Explanation & Complexity (Markdown)
- âœ… Unit Tests & Edge Cases
- âœ… Benchmark & Comparison
- âœ… Visual Diagram
- âœ… Use Cases

## ðŸ“œ Learning Methodology  

ðŸ”¹ Day 1 - Assimilation & Draft

- Reformulate the concept without AI
- Attempt an implementation without help
- Test on a simple case
- Let it rest for a few hours

ðŸ”¹ Day 2-3 - Implementation & Documentation

- Write a clean version without copying the previous one
- Add tests & edge cases
- Document with Markdown + Diagram

ðŸ”¹ Day 4-5 - Validation & Automation

- Verify and optimize
- Compare via benchmarks
- Integrate with GitHub Actions automated tests


---

## ðŸš€ Running Tests  

Each algorithm is tested with **unit tests** and a **benchmark**.  
ðŸ’» To run a unit test in C++ with Google Test:  

```sh
g++ -o quick_sort_test quick_sort_test.cpp -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread
./quick_sort_test
```

ðŸ’» To run a benchmark:

```sh
g++ -o quick_sort_benchmark quick_sort_benchmark.cpp
./quick_sort_benchmark
```
